# Tutorial title

> In this section, describe the scenario that is being demonstrated. The scenario should be defined with enough detail that there are no decision points for the user. After the description, include a simple TOC. For example:

This demonstration shows how to connect MongoDB databases running in three separate Kubernetes clusters.

To complete this demonstration, do the following:

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Step 1: Procedure title](#step-1-procedure-title)
* [Step 2: Another procedure](#step-2-another-procedure)
* [Next steps](#next-steps)


## Prerequisites

> Based on the scenario that you described above, determine the state the user should have in order to begin the procedures. State each prereq as a condition or requirement. For example:

* You have access to three Kubernetes clusters.
* A MongoDB instance is installed on each Kubernetes cluster.
* The [skoot tool](https://github.com/skubaproject/skoot) is available on your computer.


## Step 1: Procedure title

> Break the demo into discrete procedures. Each procedure should cover a single logical "chunk" of work. The procedure should start with a short intro that explains why the user should care about the procedure, and then a set of numbered steps. As a general rule of thumb, try to keep each procedure to eight or fewer steps. For example:

First, you create an application router network to connect the Kubernetes clusters.

1. Create a network configuration file that defines the application router network.

2. Create the application router network.

3. Verify that the application router network is created.

4. More steps...


## Step 2: Another procedure


## Next steps

> Describe anything that the user might want to do next after completing the tutorial.
